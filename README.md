English · [中文](./README.zh.md)

A GitHub Actions workflow that runs every morning at 08:00 CST. It tracks GitHub activity from AI CLI tools, OpenClaw and its peer projects in the AI agent ecosystem, scrapes official news and research from Anthropic and OpenAI, and monitors the GitHub AI trending repos daily — then publishes English daily digests as GitHub Issues and committed Markdown files. Weekly and monthly rollup reports are also generated automatically.

## Web UI

**[https://gsscsd.github.io/big_model_radar](https://gsscsd.github.io/big_model_radar)**

Browse all historical digests in a clean, dark-themed interface — no login required. Reports are rendered from the Markdown files in this repo via GitHub Pages.

## RSS Feed

**[https://gsscsd.github.io/big_model_radar/feed.xml](https://gsscsd.github.io/big_model_radar/feed.xml)**

Subscribe in any RSS reader (Feedly, Reeder, NewsBlur, etc.) to receive new digests automatically. The feed includes the latest 30 reports across all report types, updated daily alongside `manifest.json`.

## MCP Server

**`https://big-model-radar-mcp.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`**

A hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes Big Model Radar data as tools. Any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, etc.) can query the latest AI ecosystem reports directly.

**Available tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_reports` | List available dates and report types (last N days) |
| `get_latest` | Fetch the most recent report of a given type |
| `get_report` | Fetch a specific report by date and type |
| `search` | Keyword search across recent reports |

**Claude Desktop setup** — add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "big-model-radar": {
      "url": "https://big-model-radar-mcp.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving. You can then ask Claude things like:
- *"What's the latest in AI CLI tools?"* → calls `get_latest`
- *"Search for Claude Code mentions this week"* → calls `search`
- *"Show me the AI trending report for 2026-03-05"* → calls `get_report`

**OpenClaw setup** — run the following command:

```bash
openclaw mcp add --transport http big-model-radar https://big-model-radar-mcp.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

Or add it manually to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "big-model-radar": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://big-model-radar-mcp.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev"
    }
  }
}
```

You can then ask OpenClaw things like:
- *"What's the latest in AI CLI tools?"* → calls `get_latest`
- *"Search for Claude Code mentions this week"* → calls `search`
- *"Show me the AI trending report for 2026-03-05"* → calls `get_report`

**Self-hosting** — deploy your own instance from the `mcp/` directory:

```bash
cd mcp
pnpm install
wrangler deploy
```

## Telegram Channel

**[t.me/agents_radar](https://t.me/agents_radar)**

Subscribe to get daily digest notifications pushed directly to Telegram. Each message links to all reports for that day plus the Web UI and RSS feed.

## Tracked sources

### AI CLI tools (GitHub)

| Tool | Repository |
|------|-----------|
| Claude Code | [anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) |
| OpenAI Codex | [openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) |
| Gemini CLI | [google-gemini/gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | [github/copilot-cli](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli) |

| Qwen Code | [QwenLM/qwen-code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code) |

### Claude Code Skills (GitHub)

| Source | Repository |
|--------|-----------|
| Claude Code Skills | [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) |

PRs and issues are fetched without a date filter and sorted by popularity (comment count), so the report always reflects the most actively discussed skills — not just the newest.

### OpenClaw + AI agent ecosystem (GitHub)

OpenClaw is tracked as the primary reference project. Ten peer projects in the personal AI assistant / autonomous agent space are tracked alongside it for cross-ecosystem comparison.

| Project | Repository | Stars |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| OpenClaw | [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | 240.5k |
| NanoBot | [HKUDS/nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) | 26.9k |
| Zeroclaw | [zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw) | 21.2k |
| PicoClaw | [sipeed/picoclaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw) | 21.1k |
| NanoClaw | [qwibitai/nanoclaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) | 16.6k |
| IronClaw | [nearai/ironclaw](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw) | 3.9k |

| EasyClaw | [gaoyangz77/easyclaw](https://github.com/gaoyangz77/easyclaw) | 102 |

### GitHub AI Trending

Two data sources are fetched in parallel every day:

| Source | Details |
|--------|---------|
| [github.com/trending](https://github.com/trending?since=daily) | Today's trending repos — parsed from HTML; includes today's new star count |
| GitHub Search API | Repos active in the last 7 days matching 6 AI topics: `llm`, `ai-agent`, `rag`, `vector-database`, `large-language-model`, `machine-learning` |

The LLM filters out non-AI repos from the trending list, classifies the rest by dimension (AI infrastructure / agents / applications / models / RAG), and extracts trend signals.

### Hacker News

Top AI stories from the last 24 hours, fetched via the [Algolia HN Search API](https://hn.algolia.com/api). Six queries run in parallel (`AI`, `LLM`, `Claude`, `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `machine learning`), results are deduplicated and ranked by points. The top 30 stories are passed to the LLM for analysis.

### Official web content (sitemap-based)

| Organization | Site | Tracked sections |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | [anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com) | `/news/`, `/research/`, `/engineering/`, `/learn/` |
| OpenAI | [openai.com](https://openai.com) | research, publication, release, company, engineering, milestone, learn-guides, safety, product |

New articles are detected by comparing sitemap `lastmod` timestamps against a persisted state file (`digests/web-state.json`). On the **first run**, up to 25 recent articles per site are fetched and a comprehensive overview report is generated. On subsequent runs, only new or updated URLs trigger a report; if nothing changed, the web report step is skipped entirely.

## Features

- Fetches issues, pull requests, and releases updated in the last 24 hours across all tracked repos
- Tracks trending Claude Code Skills — sorted by community engagement, not recency
- Generates a per-tool summary for each CLI repository and a cross-tool comparative analysis
- Generates a deep OpenClaw project report plus a cross-ecosystem comparison against 10 peer projects
- Scrapes official Anthropic and OpenAI web content via sitemaps; detects new articles incrementally
- Monitors GitHub Trending daily + searches 6 AI topic tags; classifies repos by dimension and extracts trend signals
- Fetches top-30 AI stories from Hacker News (last 24h, ranked by points); generates community sentiment report
- Publishes GitHub Issues for each report type; commits Markdown files to `digests/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Runs on a daily schedule via GitHub Actions; supports manual triggering
- All tracked repositories are configurable via `config.yml` — no code changes needed
- Centralized locale system via `locales/*.json` — 21 supported languages with `t()` catalog in `src/strings.ts`

## Setup

### 1. Fork this repository

### 2. Customize `config.yml` (optional)

Edit `config.yml` in the repo root to add, remove, or replace the tracked repositories. The file is fully commented. No code changes are needed — the pipeline reads it on every run and falls back to built-in defaults if the file is absent.

```yaml
# Add a new CLI tool
cli_repos:
  - id: my-tool
    repo: owner/my-ai-cli
    name: My AI Tool

# Add a new peer project to the OpenClaw ecosystem comparison
openclaw_peers:
  - id: my-agent
    repo: owner/my-agent
    name: My Agent
```

> The `languages` field at the top of `config.yml` controls which locales are active. Defaults to `["en"]` if absent. See the full list of 21 supported languages at the top of this page.

### 3. Add Secrets

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

| Secret | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ✅ | API key for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | optional | API endpoint override. Leave unset for OpenAI, or set a compatible provider URL such as `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | optional | Model name passed to `chat/completions`, e.g. `gpt-4.1-mini` |
| `PAGES_URL` | recommended | Public site base URL, e.g. `https://your-user.github.io/big_model_radar`. Prefer a repository variable for this |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | optional | Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). If set, a message is sent after each digest run |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | optional | Telegram chat/channel/group ID to send notifications to. Required if you enable Telegram notifications |

> `GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by GitHub Actions.
>
> Backward compatibility: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, and `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` are still accepted as aliases, but new setups should use `OPENAI_*`.

**Setting up Telegram notifications** (optional):
1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram, create a bot, and copy the token
2. Add the bot to your channel/group, or start a DM with it
3. Get the chat ID via [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) or the [getUpdates](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates) API
4. Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` as repository secrets
5. Add `PAGES_URL` as a repository variable under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**

> If neither secret is set, the notification step is silently skipped.
> If `PAGES_URL` is unset, the site URL is derived from `owner/repo` as `https://owner.github.io/repo`.

### 3. Enable the workflow

Confirm the workflow is enabled in the **Actions** tab.

To test immediately, go to **Actions → Daily Big Model Radar → Run workflow**.

> **First run note**: The web content step will fetch up to 50 articles (25 per site) and may take a few extra minutes. Subsequent runs are fast — only new articles are processed.

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm install

export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxx
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxx
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
export DIGEST_REPO=your-username/big_model_radar  # optional; omit to only write files

pnpm start
```

## Running tests

```bash
pnpm test        # run all tests (vitest)
pnpm test:watch  # run in watch mode during development
```

## Output format

Files are written to `digests/YYYY-MM-DD/`:

| File | Content | GitHub Issue label |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `ai-cli.md` | CLI digest — cross-tool comparison + per-tool details | `digest` |
| `ai-agents.md` | OpenClaw deep report + cross-ecosystem comparison + 10 peer details | `openclaw` |
| `ai-web.md` | Official web content report (only written when new content exists) | `web` |
| `ai-trending.md` | GitHub AI trending report — repos classified by dimension + trend signals (only written when data is available) | `trending` |
| `ai-hn.md` | Hacker News AI community digest — top stories + sentiment analysis (only written when fetch succeeds) | `hn` |

A shared state file `digests/web-state.json` tracks which web URLs have been seen; it is committed alongside the daily digests.
